        "So we've kind of got nearly got all of our infrastructure in place before we do this. Some pieces of python, which not everybody knows and I want to kind of talk about and kind of computer science concepts I want to talk about. So that's what our six foundations is about. So this whole section is just going to tell. It is going to talk about some stuff in Python that you might not have come across before, or maybe it's a review for some of you as well. And it's all stuff we're going to be using basically in the next notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "So that's why I want to talk to cover it. So we're going to be creating a learner class. So a learner class is going to be a very general purpose training loop, which we can get to to do anything that we want it to do. And we're going to be creating things called callbacks to make that happen. And so therefore we're going to spend a few moments talking about what are callbacks, how are they used in in computer science, how are they implemented? Look at some examples. They come up a lot. \n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the most common place that you see callbacks in software is for doing events of events from some graphical user interface. So the main graphical user interface library in Jupyter notebooks is called ipywidgets, and we can create a widget like a pattern . And when we display it, it shows me a button and at the moment it doesn't do anything. If I click on it. What we can do though, is we can add and onclick callback to it,we're going to pass it a function which is called when you click it. So to find that function. So I'm going to say w.on_click(f) is going to assign the f function to the on_click callback. Now, if I click this, there you go. It's doing it. Now, what does that mean? \n",
        "\n",
        "Well, a callback is simply a callable that you've provided. So remember, a callable is a more general version of a function. So in this case, it is a function that you've provided that will be called back to when something happens. So in this case, so something that's happening is that they're clicking a button. So this is how we are defining and using a callback as a GUI event. So basically everything in ipywidgets, if you want to create your own graphical user interfaces for Jupyter, you can do it with ipy widgets and by using these callbacks. So these particular kinds of callbacks are called events, but it's just a callback. All right, so that's somebody else's callback. \n",

        "So here's how we can modify our calculation routine such that you can optionally pass it a callback. And so all of these codes are the same, except we've added this one line of code that says if there's a callback, then call it and pass in what what we're up to. So then we could create our callback function. So this is just like we created a our callback function f let's create a show_progress callback function that's going to tell us how far we've got. So now if we call slow calculation passing in our callback, you can say it's going to call this function at the end of each step. \n",
        "\n",
        "So here we've created our own callback so there's nothing special about a callback. Like it doesn't require its own like syntax. It's not a new concept, it's just an idea really, which is the idea of passing in a function which some other function will call at particular times, such as at the end of a step or such as when you click a button. So that's what we mean by callbacks. \n",
        "\n",
        "We don't have to define the function ahead of time. We could define the function at the same time that we call the slow calculation by using Lambda. So as we've discussed before, Lambda just defines a function, but it doesn't give it a name. So here's a function that takes one parameter and prints out exactly the same thing as before. So here's the same way as doing it, but using a lambda, we could make it more sophisticated now and rather than always saying also we finished epoc, whatever we could have let you pass in an exclamation and we print that out. And so in this case, we could now have our lambda call that function. And so one of the things that we can do now is to again, we can create a function that returns a function. And so we could create a     make_ _show_progress function where you pass in the exclamation mark. We could then create in this no need to give it a name. \n",
        "it's just return it directly. We can return a function that calls that exclamation. So here we are passing in Nice, and that's exactly the same as doing something like what we've done before. We could say instead of using a lambda we can create in a function like this. So here is now a function that returns, a function that says exactly the same thing. Okay, so one way with the lambda when we're allowed to lambda and one of the reasons I wanted to show you that is so  we can do exactly the same thing using partial. So with partial, it's going to do exactly the same thing as this kind of makes show progress. It's going to call, show progress and pass. Okay. I guess so is again an example of a function returning a function. And so this is a function that calls show progress, passing in this as the first parameter. And Again, it does exactly the same thing. Okay. So where you get we tend to use partial a lot. So that's certainly something worth spending time practicing. Now, as we've discussed, Python doesn't care about types in particular, and there's nothing about any of this that requires cb to be a function.\n",

So create that an object of that class a.b equals two because I set b to two. Okay. Now when you say dot B, that's just in texture. Good.

Now getattr behind the scenes. It's actually calling something called __getattr__ and by default it'll use the version in the object based class. So here's something just like a it's got a and b defined, but I've also got time getattr defined and so __getattr__ It's only called for stuff that hasn't been defined yet and it'll pass in the key of the the name of the attribute. So generally speaking, if the first character is an underscore, it's going to be private or special. So That's going to raise an attribute error.

So I'm hoping that you all kind of go back over this, revise it slowly, experiment with it, and look up some additional resources and ask on the forum and stuff. That's not clear. Remember, everybody has parts of the course that's really easy for them and parts of the course that are completely unfamiliar for them. And so if this particular part of the course is completely unfamiliar to you, it's not because this is harder or going to be more difficult or whatever. It's just so happens that this is a bit that you're less familiar with. Or maybe this stuff about calculus in the last lesson was a bit that you're less familiar with. There isn't really anything, particularly in the course, that's more difficult than other parts. It's just that, you know, based on whether you happen to have that background. \n",

And if you Yeah, if you do get lost, please ask because people are very keen to help. If you've tried asking on the forum, hopefully you noticed that people are really keen to help. All right. So I think this has been a pretty successful lesson. We've we've got to a point where we've got a pretty nicely optimized training loop. We actually understand exactly what data load is and data sets do. We've got an optimizer. We've been playing with hugging face data sets and we've got those working really smoothly. So we really feel like we're in a pretty good position to to write our generic learner training loop and then we can start building and experimenting with lots of models. So look forward to seeing you next. Time to doing that together. Okay. \n"
